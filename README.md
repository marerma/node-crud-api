The application runs on port 4000 in a single mode and 4000-4000n in a multi mode.

## Endpoints

1. Implemented endpoint `api/users`:
    - **GET** `api/users` is used to get all persons
        - Server should answer with `status code` **200** and all users records
    - **GET** `api/users/{userId}` 
        - Server should answer with `status code` **200** and record with `id === userId` if it exists
        - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
        - Server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
    - **POST** `api/users` is used to create record about new user and store it in database
        - Server should answer with `status code` **201** and newly created record
        - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if request `body` does not contain **required** fields
    - **PUT** `api/users/{userId}` is used to update existing user
        - Server should answer with` status code` **200** and updated record
        - Server should answer with` status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
        - Server should answer with` status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
    - **DELETE** `api/users/{userId}` is used to delete existing user from database
        - Server should answer with `status code` **204** if the record is found and deleted
        - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
        - Server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
2. Users are stored as `objects` that have following properties:
    - `id` — unique identifier (`string`, `uuid`) generated on server side
    - `username` — user's name (`string`, **required**)
    - `age` — user's age (`number`, **required**)
    - `hobbies` — user's hobbies (`array` of `strings` or empty `array`, **required**)
3. Requests to non-existing endpoints (e.g. `some-non/existing/resource`) are be handled (server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding human-friendly message)
